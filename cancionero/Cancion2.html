    <p>
Feelin' like I'm floatin'<br>
Something's in the air tonight<br>
We're speakin' with emotions<br>
Won't look away<br>
Love me at my lowest<br>
I'll love you when you're barely holdin' on<br>
Lightin' up the darkness<br>
I can be a shoulder when you're not strong<br>
<p></p>
Closer<br>
Closer to you<br>
Closer<br>
Closer to you<br>
<p></p>
Take you like my last breath<br>
Tell me that's the first step<br>
Closer with the silk dress<br>
Feelin' your warm embrace<br>
Devil always tempting<br>
But who gon' end the sentence?<br>
We're not meant to blend in<br>
Blended with all your friends<br>
Push and pull to get closer, closer<br>
<p></p>
We tried again, said I wouldn't lie, but I lied again<br>
Mama told you: Don't reply to him, this ain't right<br>
Who's wrong again? We been tired, restart again<br>
Negative and the positive bringin' us<br>
<p></p>
Closer<br>
Closer to you<br>
Closer<br>
Closer to you<br>
<p></p>
(Closer)<br>
(Closer to you)<br>
(Closer)<br>
(Closer to you)<br>
