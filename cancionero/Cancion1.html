    You went from my home to<br>
    It was nice to know you<br>
    And it breaks my heart<br>
    That we gave it our best shot<br>
    Now I'm in California<br>
    I'm still waitin' for ya<br>
    Will you change your mind?<br>
    I would give it all up<br>
    For us<br>
    <p></p>
    Ooh<br>
    I wish I could stay with you<br>
    Ooh<br>
    I wish I could stay with you<br>
    <p></p>
    Come before it's too late<br>
    I got things to say<br>
    Before I go<br>
    And there's no time to wait<br>
    We can hide away<br>
    Need to let you know that<br>
    <p></p>
    Ooh<br>
    I wish I could stay with you<br>
    (I wish I could stay with you)<br>
    Ooh<br>
    Know that I will wait for you<br>
    (Know that I will wait for you)<br>
    <p></p>
    You went from my home to<br>
    It was nice to know you<br>
    And it breaks my heart<br>
    That we gave it our best shot<br>
    Now you're in California<br>
    I'm still waitin' for ya<br>
    Will you change your mind?<br>
    I would give it all up<br>
    For us<br>
